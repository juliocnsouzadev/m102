Q: When might you want to use an arbiter?

    - To spreak the replica set over more datacenters
    - To protect against network splits

A:  - 0, 500, 88.4, 88

Q: In which of the following scenarios does it make sense to use slave delay?

Q; Imagine you're using a 5-server replica set and you have critical inserts which you do not want the potential for a rollback to happen. You also have to consider that secondaries may be taken down from to time for maintenance, leaving you with a potential 4-server replica set. Which write concern is best suited for these critical inserts?
A: w=majority

Q: Write Concern is set at the DB level and every operation on this DB must use the same Write Concern:
A: False

Q: For getLastError / WriteConcern with w=3, if you have an arbiter, it counts as one of the 3
A: False

Q: Does getLastError() need to be called if using default Write Concerns?
A: No

Q: What are some issues with using wtimeout?
A:  - A write can be made but getLastError() could report a failure
    - Each query could pontentially take the full duration of the wtimeout
    - Pile-ups of connections
